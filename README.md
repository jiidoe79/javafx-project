## JavaFX Code Editor
This is a small project, meant to learn the basics of Java/JavaFX and to produce a working text editor with a built in function to compile and run it if it is code.

## Motivation
This project is part of a code training course, and is meant to be the "showcase" of my learning.

## Code style
Entry level standard.

## Tech/framework used

<b>Built with</b>
- [Java 13](https://jdk.java.net/13/)
- [JavaFX](https://openjfx.io/)
- [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/)
- [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/promo/ultimate/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwy6T1BRDXARIsAIqCTXrKgC_p1pU7PLrbKhiJ3XSlraxjA5QsOlhQJ3OlOxYfMWyaOF6s3uwaAuJjEALw_wcB)

## Features
- Basic text editing functions

- Compile and Run function for code, output in separate splitpane consol
- Errorhandling, alerts on save and new functions
- Preferences save and load when exiting and opening program, including default filepath

## Installation
Program is not yet an executable but a Maven project, so you can only run it through Maven or any code editor supporting Maven. It uses features and functions from Java 13, so that is what you should have installed also.

## Credits
A big thank you to Jussi Pohjolainen for teaching and mentoring and also a lot of thanks to the whole Code Training Camp course for advice and support.
